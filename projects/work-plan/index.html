                    <h2>Demonstrative greenhouses and the Case Studies </h2>
                    <p2>The studies assess three greenhouse types—Low-Tech (LTG, NIOF) with Basic structures and passive climate control, Medium-Tech (MTG, UMKB) with moderate automation, and High-Tech (HTG, INKOA) with Advanced automation with climate control, AI-driven monitoring, and precision agriculture tools.</p2>
                    <p2>Growing methods include hydroponics (soilless cultivation with nutrient-rich water solutions) and aquaponics (integrated with aquaculture for sustainable nutrient cycling). Testing occurs across diverse climates: Spain (Mediterranean), Egypt (arid), and Algeria (semi-arid).</p2>
                    <p2>Key evaluation metrics cover resource efficiency, crop yield, sustainability impact, and economic viability. These case studies ensure HortiMED’s solutions are robust, scalable, and tailored to different agricultural needs across the Mediterranean region.</p2>

                    <p2>This demo-site in Qalyubia Governorate has three greenhouses. Greenhouse 1 (140 m²) with two different hydroponic systems: <b>NFT</b> (Nutrient Film Technique) and <b>FRS</b> (Floating Raft System). Greenhouse 2 (210 m²) with a hydroponic FRS unit and a traditional unit (soil-based). While, Greenhouse 3 (240 m²) with 4 concrete ponds of 40 m³ for the production of aquaculture species and an earthen pond used as sedimentation unit.</p2>
                    <p2>The system uses an earthen pond for sedimentation and features simple metal-frame greenhouses covered with plastic (winter) or shade nets (summer). Water flow is manually controlled via 5 pumps and manual ball valves, while timed air blowers regulate dissolved oxygen. All operations, including manual water quality monitoring (handheld sensors/lab tests), classify NIOF’s greenhouse as a Low Technology Greenhouse (LTG).</p2>

                    <p2>The Biskra demo-site features a 992 m² polycarbonate greenhouse (30 m² control room + two 450 m² cultivation chapels) with moderate automation, classifying it as a Medium Technology Greenhouse (MTG). It includes 5 fans and insect-proof screens for air renewal, 6 plant tables for tomato/pepper production, an east-side cooling system, retractable shade screens, and automated 3-point fogging for humidity control. Climate regulation is managed via three automata (wind, temperature/luminosity, ventilation/cooling). Additionally, UMKB operates 6 simple 500 m² polytunnels (polyethylene-covered, drip-irrigated) for testing bio-based pest strategies, though the primary focus remains the semi-automated MTG greenhouse.</p2>

                    <p2>The commercial greenhouse of 3,200 m² (80 × 40m) features a curved roof, multi-span metallic structure with a plastic cover, dedicated to hydroponic tomato production using perlite substrate bags and drip irrigation. It comprises five modules (each 8m wide × 80m long, with 5m ridge height and 3m gutter height).<br>
                    Climate control is fully automated via Sysclima (INTA Crop), while fertigation is managed by AGRONIC 5000 (Sistemes Electrònics Progrés). The greenhouse uses three climate control systems: pellet boiler heating, zenith ventilation, and shading screens. The cultivation area is undivided but includes a central corridor separating two sectors (Sector 1: ~1,540 m²; Sector 2: ~1,600 m²), each with independent fertigation control. Besides, next to the greenhouse, there is a storage room and a booth with a computer connected to the Sysclima, from which the configuration of Sysclima can be modified and where the historic data is stored in a SQL database.</p2>
