                <p2>PRIMA – Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area <a href="https://prima-med.org/" >https://prima-med.org/</a> is the most ambitious joint programme to be undertaken in the frame of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.</p2>
                <p2>PRIMA will devise new R&I approaches to improve water availability and sustainable agriculture production in a region heavily distressed by climate change, urbanisation and population growth.</p2>   
                <p2>The PRIMA programme is an Art.185 initiative supported and funded under Horizon 2020, the European Union’s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.</p2>   
                <p2>By Funding R&I through competitive calls, PRIMA aims to:</p2> 
                <p2>“build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems, to make them sustainable, and for integrated water provision and management in the Mediterranean area, to make those systems and that provision and management more climate resilient, efficient, cost-effective and environmentally and socially sustainable, and to contribute to solving water scarcity, food security, nutrition, health, well-being and migration problems upstream”.</p2>
                <p2>PRIMA also aims at to contribute to United Nations’ Agenda 2030 through the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p2>
