                <p2>The National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (NIOF) is one of the twelve national research institutions affiliated to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Egypt and considered the oldest research institution in the Middle East and the Arab region that is entirely devoted to marine research. NIOF, historically, was first established in 1924.</p2>
                <p2>The mandate of the NIOF was specified in the Presidential Decree No. 436 of 1983 as follows: “To maintain, protect and promote the different Egyptian aquatic environments as well as carry out research studies that contribute to the development and sustainability of water resources, whether through natural fisheries or aquaculture”. </p2>   
                <p2>NIOF works on the achievement of sustainable development of marine and fresh water resources through increasing their potentials for food production, combating pollution from all sources and working towards reducing poverty and improving the standard of living by developing and introducing new techniques in fisheries and aquaculture.</p2>
